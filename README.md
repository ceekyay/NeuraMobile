Electric Wheelchair controlled using EEG headset. This project is developed using Python and LUA. Please message me at ckovuri16@gmail.com if you intend on discussing how I created it or for future collaboration. 
Project Description:
Mind Controlled Electric Wheelchair.
> Assistive technology aimed at users with disabilities such as paralysis, cerebral palsy, etc.
> Designed and implemented custom EEG headset using a 32-bit OpenBCI board kit.
> User brainwaves are recorded & analyzed using OpenViBE API Brain Interface software in real time.
> Unique brainwave signatures are then translated into different directions for guiding the wheelchair using python.
